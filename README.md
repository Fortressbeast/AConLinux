# AConLinux
As always a big thanks to the groups that are working to keep our favorite game alive.

**NEW VERSION: Lutris working despite some bugs, still trying to iron things out** 

Install and play tested on PopOS 22.04 and Fedora 37. Also tested installing in Manjaro vm, but did not play test due to lack of 3d support.

Scripts to install Asheron's Call, Decal, Virindi bundle, and Thwargle using Lutris (See install doc for dirs). This was written on PopOS 22.04/Fedora 37. Still learning so there may be a lot of issues, but there seems to be a need and I like solving puzzles.

For just AC you only need AC.yaml. For Decal ect you need to run through the AC install first and then the other yaml files. Please refer the dirs for both setups. There are bugs and quirks still.... 

Take it for what it is, and dont hold me responsible if it bricks you linux install, steals your car, and burns down your house...


Feel like getting me a coffee or helping me purchase some books or equipment to further my studies? Part of all donations recieved will be given to other open source projects that I use.
