# AConLinux
As always a big thanks to the groups that are working to keep our favorite game alive.

**NEW VERSION COMING SOON(ISH). Decided that it will be easier for everyone if i swith to a Play on Linux script. No ETA as of yet.**

Script to install Asheron's Call, Decal*, Virindi bundle*, and Thwargle* using Play on Linux (*WIP). This was written and tested on Ubuntu 19.10, but should work on on others(maybe?). Still new to linux, and scripting so there may be a lot of issues, but there seems to be a need and I want to learn.

The script is a Work in Progess and as such does not have any checking to make sure files exists or other "user proof" logic.

Instructions are given in PoL message windows when needed. Consider running Wine32ForPoL.sh (Deb) to install the prerequisites.

Take it for what it is, and dont hold me responsible if it bricks you linux install, steals your car, and burns down your house...


Still huge thanks to Aerbax for teaching me a lot of bash tricks.


Feel like getting me a coffee or helping me purchase some books or equipment to further my studies? Part of all donations recieved will be given to other open source projects that I use.
